<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A monitoring solution for Docker hosts and containers with [loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/).

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
